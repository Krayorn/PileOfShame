The framework used is Symfony and we're using the doctrine ORM to access our SQLITE database. 

Write simple code without side effects but avoid repetitions

- directly set a class properties in the constructor instead of creating them outside and assigning them in the construct
- use a view method on each entity that returns an array containing the data we want to return
