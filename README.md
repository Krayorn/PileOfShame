### Pile of shame

In the warhammer scene and sometimes in the wargaming / miniature scene more in general, a pile of shame is the pile of unpainted (or even sometimes unbuilt!) miniatures that you have. 

This website is made to track your collection, see how much you've got to paint and how much is already painted.
